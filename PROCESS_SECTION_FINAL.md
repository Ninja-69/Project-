# Process Section - Final Design Integration

## 🎨 Theme Alignment & "100x Better" Features

I have fully integrated the Process section with the global design language of the website (Hero, Services) while maintaining the advanced "100x better" animations.

### ✨ Design Consistency Updates
- **Typography**: Aligned headings and subheadings with `Hero.tsx` and `Services.tsx`.
  - Main Heading: `text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold bg-gradient-to-b from-white via-white to-white/40`
  - Subheading: `text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-400 font-light`
- **Badges**: Added the standard `Badge` component ("Our Process") for consistency.
- **Animations**: Applied `blur-in`, `fade-up`, and `zoom-in` effects to all text elements using the `Reveal` component.

### 🚀 Advanced Interactive Features (Preserved)
1.  **AI-Powered Workflow**: Real-time typing code editor with scanning beam.
2.  **Services for All Sectors**: Holographic scanning card with dynamic growth bars.
3.  **System Efficiency**: Live 0-90% counter with particle flow animations.
4.  **Business Growth**: Live revenue tracker ($0-$80k) with dynamic graph.

### 🔄 Auto-Loop Functionality
- The section automatically cycles through the 4 steps (Workflow -> Services -> Efficiency -> Growth -> Loop).
- **Pause on Hover**: The loop intelligently pauses when the user hovers over any step or the visual card, allowing them to read details without interruption.

The section is now a seamless part of the premium experience. 🌟
