## 📞 WHAT TO EXPECT SECTION

### Section Title
What to Expect on the Call

### Section Subtitle
Here's how the 20 minutes break down:

### Step 1: Context (5 min)
You'll share your current lead gen setup, biggest bottleneck, and what you've already tried. No prep needed—just bring your main pain point.

### Step 2: AI Opportunity Mapping (10 min)
We'll walk through your funnel and show you exactly where AI can slot in: personalized outreach, lead qualification, follow-up sequences, or CRM automation. Specific to your niche and stack.

### Step 3: Action Plan (5 min)
You'll leave with a clear next step—either a roadmap to build yourself, tools to try, or how a done-for-you engagement would work (zero pressure).

### De-risk Statement
No hard pitch. No generic advice. You get real value whether we work together or not.

## ⭐ SOCIAL PROOF

### Authority Line
Trusted by 50+ B2B agencies to automate outbound without losing the human touch.

### Testimonial 1
> "We went from 8 qualified calls/month to 23 in 6 weeks. The AI system runs while we sleep and feels like we hired 3 SDRs without the payroll."
> 
> **— Marcus T., B2B SaaS Agency ($18k/month)**

### Testimonial 2
> "I was skeptical about AI being 'too robotic,' but their approach kept our voice and actually improved reply rates. Saved me 12+ hours/week on manual outreach."
> 
> **— Sarah K., Marketing Agency Owner ($32k/month)**

## ✅ IS THIS FOR YOU?

### Perfect For You If:
- Run a B2B agency, consultancy, or service business doing $1k–$50k/month
- Already have some traffic or leads but struggle with consistent outreach at scale
- Know AI is the future but don't know where to start or how to avoid the "robotic" trap
- Want leverage without hiring more people or blowing up your current workflow

### Not For You If:
- You have zero traffic or warm leads yet (you need fundamentals first)
- You're just curious about AI but have no intention to implement in the next 90 days
- You're looking for a $500 DIY course—we focus on done-for-you and done-with-you

## ⏰ LIMITED AVAILABILITY

### Title
Limited Availability

### Body
We only take 3 new implementation clients per month.

Not artificial scarcity—we personally oversee every build and can't scale past that without quality dropping.

That means booking slots fill fast. If you see open times, grab one now.

## ❓ FAQ / OBJECTIONS

### Q1: Is this just a sales pitch?
**A:** No. This is a strategy session first. You'll get a concrete action plan whether you hire us, build in-house, or do nothing. If there's a fit and you want to explore working together, we'll cover that in the last 2 minutes. Zero pressure.

### Q2: What if I'm not technical?
**A:** Perfect—most of our clients aren't. We handle the technical setup, integrations, and AI training. You focus on reviewing the output and closing deals.

### Q3: Will this work in my specific niche/industry?
**A:** We've built AI outbound systems for SaaS, agencies, consultants, and B2B service companies. On the call, we'll diagnose if your niche has enough signal for AI to work (some verticals don't—and we'll tell you honestly).

### Q4: How long is the call?
**A:** 20 minutes. If we're moving fast and you're getting value, we might go 25. We respect your time.

### Q5: What happens after the call?
**A:** You'll get an email recap with your custom roadmap and recommended next steps. If you want to move forward with done-for-you, we'll send a proposal. If not, you still keep the roadmap—no strings.

### Q6: Do I need to prepare anything?
**A:** Nope. Just bring your main bottleneck (e.g., "We can't keep up with follow-ups" or "Cold email reply rates are tanking"). We'll take it from there.
